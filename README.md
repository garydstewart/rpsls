is an extension of the well known game Rock Paper Scissors made popular by Sheldon on Big Bang Theory.
 
In the traditional game, Rock Paper Scissors, players would often tie. This introduces two new elements, Lizard, and Spock

 Players pick one of the items simultaneously and then compare the results to determine the winner.
